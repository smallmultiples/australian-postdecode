# Visualising Australian Postcodes

## Australian Postdecode

### Backlog
- general aesthetic improvements to make it look different to the original
- general UX/UI improvements
- deploy.

### Data
Based on https://www.matthewproctor.com/australian_postcodes and then a geocode here (somewhat incorrect) https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wKYujJCXM_9lCqs7PR8EETpXEtvpqRsVzTq0XDRIQqs/edit?ouid=116398455771499245572&usp=sheets_home&ths=true

## Connecting Australian Postcodes

Original created by https://eagereyes.org/zipscribble-maps/interactive-zipscribble-map including an incomplete Australian version https://eagereyes.org/zipscribble-maps/australia

Prototype in Carto just simply joining the lines in sequence https://smallmultiples.carto.com/builder/14ba493f-0b2f-4350-bfac-2e45c30fe7dd

### Backlog
- Process/data ref/source/limitations
- Label outliers
- Ideally show direction (as in 2000 -> 2001)
- Ideally group by state
- Probably need to remove the "MC"s (mail centres) and other postcodes that aren't ones that people are familiar with (ie: live in).
